# IHF-Project-Frontend

The IHF-Project-Frontend repository is a template of Phaser, a fully mobile responsive, portrait and landscape compatible template for **HTML5 games** written using the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) 3 game engine. See it online at: [enclavegames.github.io/Enclave-Phaser-Template/](https://enclavegames.github.io/Enclave-Phaser-Template/)

It is my own point of view on building a structure for an HTML5 game. If you think something can be improved feel free to send the pull request.
