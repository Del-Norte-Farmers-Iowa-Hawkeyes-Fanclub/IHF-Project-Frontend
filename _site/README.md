# Agile Manifesto



1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools:

We prioritize effective communication and collaboration among team members over relying solely on tools and processes. We are going to hold regular meetings and discussion in our Discord Server. This will ensure that we are all on the same page. 


2. Working Software WITH Comprehensive Documentation:

Our focus is on delivering working software that integrates the farming and NBA ideas effectively while also documenting our errors and processes to ensure retainment of knowledge and new learnings. Prototyping and development are crucial stages where we iterate and refine our ideas. We must make sure to document the following processes:

1. Integrating Projects into One Platform

2. Combined Cashflow + Currency System


3. Peer and Teacher Collaboration:

We engage with our classmates, teacher, and potential users throughout the development process to gather feedback and ensure that our integrated platform exceeds expectations. Testing will allow for the refinement of our features and prioritize enhancements.


4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan:

To start off the trimester, our group has been quite misaligned with group memmbers being absent, ideas being loose, etc. However, we embrace change and adapt our plans as needed based on feedback and insights gathered during the development process. Agile methodologies allow us to respond quickly to new requirements or unexpected challenges, ensuring that our platform will keep moving and become more valuable over time.
